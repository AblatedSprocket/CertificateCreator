Certificate Creator Revision 1:



NOTICE: Certificate Creator will generate certificates in the directory it is initialized from. If you would like to move Certificate Creator to a different directory, close the application, delete the generated resources folder, move the "CertificateCreator.jar" file to the desired directory, and reinitialize Certificate Creator.



General:
Certificate Creator generates student certificates automatically using a user-specified stuent list and .docx template. All program functionality is detailed in order of chronological steps that should be taken for proper setup of Certificate Creator on first use.

On first use, Certificate Creater generates a resources folder in the directory it is executed from. While not required, it is recommended that any and all student lists and certificate templates be stored in this folder. The "data.properties" file should be ignored. Any user-made changes to this file may corrupt Certificate Creator. Should this occur, deleting the "data.properties" file should resolve any issues.



Set Student List:
The set student list button opens a windows explorer window which is used to choose the desired student list. Opening a file from this explorer window will restart Certificate Creator and populate the list on the right side of Certificate Creator's home window. If the student list is moved or deleted, a notification will appear upon startup of Certificate Creator announcing that the selected student list no longer exists.

Certificate Creator is designed to take exported text (.txt) files from PowerSchool as student lists. Other files will work provided that the first line is a header and the list of students is divided into at least two columns with "First_Name" and "Last_Name" as the first rows in each column.

Certificate Creator looks for "First_Name" and "Last_Name" explicitly, so when a list is exported from PowerSchools, as many columns in any order can be included in the file used by Certificate Creator.



Set Certificate Template:
The "Set Certificate Template" button opens a windows explorer window which is used to choose the desired certificate template. Only word documents written using xml (.docx) will function as templates. If the wrong file type is selected, a notification will appear requesting that another file be selected. If the certificate template is moved or deleted, a notification will appear announcing that the template no longer exists once a student name is clicked. If you are modifying or creating your own template, please adhere to guidelines (see Modifying/Creating Template).



Specify Student:
After the student list and certificate template are set and the student list is properly populated, you can either scroll through the list to find the desired student or begin typing the desired name into the "Student Name" field. As you type, the list will filter names that match the letters typed.



Generate Certificate:
Once the desired student is located in the list, clicking the name once will prompt for certificate generation confirmation. If the file already exists, the user will be prompted to overwrite it. Once written, certificate can be found in the same folder as Certificate Creator.



Modifying/Creating Template:
When creating a template, ensure margins are set to 0.25" on all sides and the page orientation is set to landscape. Additionally, all text should be removed from the template. Font, font size, indentation, and text content are generated by CertificateCreator and cannot be changed by the user at this point. Any images added to the template (border, seals, electronic signatures, etc.) should be set independently of text. In Microsoft Word 2010 this can be done as follows:

1. Right click the image
2. Select the menu item entitled "Size and Position" or "Layout Options"
3. Navigate to the "Position" tab on the top left of the Layout Options window
4. Under "Horizontal" and "Vertical" click the bubbles for "Absolute Position"
5. In the dropdown menus following "to the right of" and "below" select the "Page" option
